# seam-carving-python

This is a Python3 implementation of the seam carving algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving), improving upon code from a prior class project (https://github.com/thomas2711/seam-carving-python/tree/master). 
<br><br>
The implementation is not yet as complete as the version in the above [branch](https://github.com/thomas2711/seam-carving-python/tree/master), but contains a number of efficiency improvements.
